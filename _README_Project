README @ Project File: Ship Pose Estimator

SYNTAX:
'_number' means this is a field in the class, and should NOT be changed outside the class without knowing what your doing.


Project setup:
- All imagefiltering, blob, keypoint tracking etc should go in SingleImageAnalysis.py or classes under it.
- All camera calibration should go in CameraGroup or Camera, or classes under these.
